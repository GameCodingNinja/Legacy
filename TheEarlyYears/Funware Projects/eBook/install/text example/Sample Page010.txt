	A farmer dies and goes to hell.  While down there the Devil notices that the farmer is not suffering like the rest. He checks the gages and sees that it's 90 degrees and about 80% humidity.  So he goes over to the farmer and asks why he's so happy. The farmer says "I like it here.  The temperature is just like plowing my fields in June."

	The Devil isn't happy with the farmer's answer and decides to get him, so he goes over and turns up the temperature to 100 degrees and the humidity to 90%.

	After turning everything up he goes looking for the farmer.  He finds him standing around just as happy as can be.  The Devil quizzes the farmer again as to why he's so happy. The farmer says "This is even better. It's like pulling weeds in the fields during July."

	The Devil, now upset, decides to really make the farmer suffer. He goes over to the controls and turns the heat up to 120 degrees and the humidity to 100%.

	"Now lets see what the farmer is up to," he says. So he goes looking for the farmer. He finds him sitting on the floor even happier then before. The Devil can't figure it out. He asks the farmer why he's happy now. The farmer replies, "This is great, it's just like working in the silo with my friends in August."

	The Devil says "That's it, I'll get this farmer." He goes over and turns the temperature down to a freezing 25 degrees and no humidity.  "Let's see what the farmer has to say about this."

	The Devil looks around and finds the farmer jumping up and down for joy and yelling, "THE CUBS HAVE FINALLY WON THE WORLD SERIES!"
