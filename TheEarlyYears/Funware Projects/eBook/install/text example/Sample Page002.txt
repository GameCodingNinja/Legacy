Administratium

	The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by Delco Electronics physicists. The element, tetatively named Administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic number of zero. However, it does have one neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These particles are held together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like  particles called morons.

	Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert, however it can be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction which it comes incontact with. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete when it would have normally  occurred in less than one second.

	Administratium has a normal half life of approximately three years. At that time it doesn't actually decay. Instead it undergoes a reorganization in which assistant neutrona, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons all exchange places. Some studies have shown that the atomicmass actually increases after each reorganization.  Research at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as government agencies, large corporations and universities and can usually be found in the newest, best maintained buildings.  Scientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy productive reaction where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administratium  can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results are not promising.
