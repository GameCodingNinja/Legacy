	A fellow from New York City was in Atlanta, GA, visiting family. One day he decided to take a walk around the area where his relatives lived to enjoy their fine, comfortable Southern way of life - something he was not accustomed to, being from the sleaze-bucket of NYC.

	While he was walking he happened upon a pit bull attacking a small child. His instincts took over, and he ran to the child's aid.  He grabbed the dog, pulled him from the child, and choked the bastard until he was dead.

	As the dead animal lay at his feet, a man came running over from the other side of the street.  He announced that he was the star reporter for the Atlanta newspaper, and he would make the rescuer famous. "ATLANTA MAN SAVES CHILD FROM GRUESOME DEATH," the headlines would proclaim.

	The would-be savior explained that it was very nice, but he was from New York City - not Atlanta. The next day the headlines of the Atlanta paper read: "YANKEE BASTARD KILLS FAMILY PET."
