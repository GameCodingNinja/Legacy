	A girl asks her boyfriend to come over friday night and have dinner with her parents.  Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time.

	Well the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to ge some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour.  He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. At the register the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack.  The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all. That night, the boy shows up at the girls parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door.  "Oh I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!"

	The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated.  The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head.  A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer.  Still with his head down 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.

	Finally after 20 minutes with his head down the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you were so religious." The boy turns and whispers back,  "I had no idea your father was a pharmacist".
