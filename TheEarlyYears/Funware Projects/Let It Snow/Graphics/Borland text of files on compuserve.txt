  illegal in both ANSI C and the ANSI draft  for C++.  Microsoft has
  acknowledged the problem in MIDL and will correct it in a future version.
  Future versions of Borland C++  will revert to the previous behavior of
  rejecting this syntax as  soon as the fix from Microsoft is available.

  A GPF would occur when a gigantic project was debugged in the IDE. This
  was caused by having each file and their include files's full  paths placed
  into a single segment.  The storage has been expanded  to 2 segments,
  this doubling the capacity.  A check for exceeding this limit has also been
  added thus preventing GPF's.

  In Windows the pointer returned by malloc() is really a selector. When you
  malloc()  more than 64k, Windows will  set  up  multiple selectors.  To use
  the  pointer you need to increment the offset until it reaches 0x0000 again
  (it always starts at 0x0000).   You then need to add a constant value to
  the segment (Petzold  says 8 for  protected  mode, 0x1000 for real mode.

  Occasionally TLINK will generate a "Table limit exceeded" message.  This
  message is generally caused when an internal linker table containing
  symbols overflows.  This table is referred to as the symbol table.  The
  symbol table starts out at 80K bytes and grows dynamically up to a limit of
  256K bytes.  The reason for this limit is one of speed.

  memory model is being used.  It is far easier to crash the machine in a
  large data model (Compact, Large, and Huge) than in a small data model
  (Tiny, Small, and Medium.)  In the small data models, the easiest way to
  crash the machine is with a stack or heap overflow, or stack corruption.
