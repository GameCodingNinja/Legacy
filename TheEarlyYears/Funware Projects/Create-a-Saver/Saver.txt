ROUNDABOUT. Create your own custom screen saver for your machine, class, or entire school.
Select artwork images for science, social studies, math, literature, music, and art. Once you select
art, you can input your own message to appear on the screen ("Science with Mr. Jones,"  "Math is
Fun with Mrs. Smith," "Jefferson High Technology," etc.). You can also select a background screen,
font, and font size and color. In addition to subject specific images, cute generic male and female
teacher figures can be selected as well as other fun images. For those who want to be really creative,
scan in your own image (class picture, school mascot, etc.) and create any number of custom screen
savers.
